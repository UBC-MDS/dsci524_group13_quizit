        Conducts a multiple-choice quiz and provides optional result tracking.

        This method randomly selects `n` questions from the question bank and 
        prompts the user to answer one question at a time. At the end of the quiz, 
        the function will display the total score and the time taken.

        Optional logging and score saving:
        - If `save_score` is True, the final score and time spent are saved to a file.
        - If `save_questions` is set to "all", "incorrect", or "correct", it saves the 
        corresponding questions (with their options, user answers, correct answers, and explanations) 
        to a log file.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        n : int
            The number of questions to randomly select from the question bank.
            If `n` exceeds the total number of questions in the bank, all available questions are used.
            
        save_questions : str or bool, optional (default=False)
            Specifies which questions to save to a log file.
            - "all": Saves all answered questions.
            - "incorrect": Saves only the incorrect questions.
            - "correct": Saves only the correct questions.
            - False: No questions are saved.

        save_score : bool, optional (default=False)
            If True, save the final quiz score and the time taken to a file.

        Returns:
        --------
        results : str
            A summary of the quiz, including the final score and the time used to complete the quiz.
