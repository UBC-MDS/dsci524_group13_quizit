def take_short_answer(n, save_questions=False, save_score=False) -> dict:
    """
    Allows the user to take a short-answer quiz and evaluates their score.
    
    This function displays a series of short-answer questions to the user. The user must provide their own replies for each inquiry. 
    The function compares the user's response with the proper answer to each question. The system calculates the user's score based on 
    the correctness of their replies and provides a summary with the list of properly answered and poorly answered questions.
    Additionally, it writes out the correct answers to one file and the incorrect answers to a different file.

    Parameters:
        n (int): The number of questions to present in the quiz.
        save_questions (bool): If True, saves the questions answered correctly or incorrectly to two different files.
        save_score (bool): If True, saves the score to a file.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the user's performance:
            - score (float): The percentage of correct answers.
            - correct_answers (list): A list of questions that were answered correctly.
            - incorrect_answers (list): A list of questions that were answered incorrectly.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the questions list is empty or None, the function will raise an error as there are no questions to quiz.
        TypeError: If the items in the questions list are not in the expected format (e.g., missing necessary fields).

    Example:
    take_short_answer(3, save_questions=True, save_score=True)
    """
    pass
