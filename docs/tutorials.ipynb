They discover a set of multiple-choice and short-answer questions on the internet that cover a variety of areas they expect to be tested on, including machine learning algorithms, data manipulation, and statistics. They want to periodically test themselves in order to assess their knowledge and discover areas for improvement. After completing the quiz, the package shows them their results. It displays their scores and lists the questions they answered correctly and incorrectly. The results are saved to a text file, which Jessica, Uche, and Mavis can review to track their performance over time and identify any topics they need to revisit."
