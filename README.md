A python package for creating and taking quizzes.

## Summary
### Project Summary
This Python package is designed to help users to create custom build quizzes.
The package allows users to load multiple-choice and/or short-answer question sets.
It will then randomly select a user-defined number of questions from the question sets and generate a quiz.
Quiz scores and time used will be displayed at the end of the quiz.
Optionally, users can also have their quiz scores and incorrect and correct questions in a text file. 

### Package Functions
The package has three functions: 
- `load_questions(questions: pd.DataFrame = None, input_file: str = None, question_type: QuestionType = None, has_header: bool = True, delimeter: str = None)` : allow users to load in their own multiple-choice or short answer question sets 
- `take_multiple_choice(n, save_questions=False, save_score=False)`:
    - Allow users to take a multiple-choice quiz with optional result tracking.
- `take_short_answer(n, save_questions=False, save_score=False)` : allow users to take a short answer quiz with optional result tracking.

### Python Ecosystem Integration

`dsci524_group13_quizit` is a fantastic tool for both educators and learners, providing a seamless way to create and take quizzes. Unlike other Python packages such as [`quizzer`](https://pypi.org/project/quizzer/) and [`QuizzingPackage`](https://pypi.org/project/QuizzingPackage/), this package stands out by supporting both multiple-choice and short answer formats. Additionally, it offers the unique feature of saving quiz results to a text file, making it an invaluable resource for tracking progress and performance. 
Whether you're teaching a class or studying for an exam, `dsci524_group13_quizit` is designed to make the quiz experience as smooth and effective as possible.

    shrtq_file_path = "tests/test_data/short_answer.csv"
    

    quiz = Quizit()
    mc_questions = quiz.load_questions(input_file=mcq_file_path, question_type=QuestionType.MULTIPLE_CHOICE, delimeter=";")
    shrt_questions = quiz.load_questions(input_file=shrtq_file_path, question_type=QuestionType.SHORT_ANSWER, delimeter=";")
    ```

3. **Take a multiple-choice quiz:**
    ```python
    quiz.take_multiple_choice(n=1)
    ```

4. **Take a short-answer quiz:**
    ```python
